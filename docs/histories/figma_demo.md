This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out
of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's
requests, technical details, and my actions:

1. **Initial Request**: User provided a Figma design URL and requested
   conversion to a design system folder structure, with a focus on gradual
   separation of concerns between features (logic) and design_system (UI).

2. **First Phase - Figma Design Extraction**: - I used Figma Dev Mode MCP to extract the design and convert it to
   Flutter components - Created AI-generated components following atomic design principles - Added extracted colors to app_colors.dart - Moved all generated components to ai_generated/raw_components/ folder
   per user's feedback

3. **Second Phase - Demo System Creation**:

- User requested a demo system for testing components
- I researched industry standards (Widgetbook, GoRouter patterns)
- Created a comprehensive demo shell with navigation
- Built demo pages for component showcase

4. **Third Phase - Navigation Integration**:

- User pointed out missing navigation from home screen
- I added a "디자인 시스템 데모" button to the home screen

5. **Fourth Phase - Figma Update (90-degree rotation fix)**: - User updated Figma design to remove 90-degree rotations - Requested horizontal toolbar layout instead of vertical - User explicitly rejected Phase 2 (canvas size changes) and focused
   only on toolbar fixes - I updated all components to horizontal layout with exact Figma
   dimensions

Throughout the conversation, the user emphasized:

- Gradual separation between features (logic) and design_system (UI)
- Using ai_generated folder for AI output before refinement
- Point-in-time testing and validation of designs
- Specific architectural decisions about folder structure

Key technical patterns included:

- Atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- GoRouter for navigation
- Flutter/Dart with design tokens
- MCP integration for Figma

Summary:

1.  Primary Request and Intent: - Convert Figma design (https://www.figma.com/design/MtvaMAiatLnIYEilnFKB2F/design-duplicated?node-id=21-1697&m=dev) to Flutter design system - Implement gradual separation of concerns: features folder for logic
    only, design_system folder for all UI components - Create a demo/testing environment for component showcase and team
    collaboration - Update toolbar layout from vertical (90-degree rotated) to horizontal
    layout matching updated Figma design - Build living documentation for designer-developer collaboration

2.  Key Technical Concepts:

- Figma Dev Mode MCP integration for design extraction
- Atomic Design methodology (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Flutter/Dart with Material Design
- GoRouter for declarative routing and deep linking
- Design tokens and color systems
- AI-generated code workflow with refinement process
- Component-driven development and isolation testing
- Separation of concerns architecture

3.  Files and Code Sections: - `lib/design_system/tokens/app_colors.dart` - Added Figma-extracted colors for toolbar system - Important for consistent theming across components - Code snippet: Added toolbarBackground, penRed, penBlue, penGreen,
    penBlack colors

- `lib/design_system/ai_generated/figma_toolbar_design_v2.dart`

154px color palette, etc.

- `lib/design_system/ai_generated/raw_components/color_palette.dart`
- Updated PenColorPalette to horizontal layout (154px width, 40px

height) - Changed from ToolbarSection to direct Container with Row layout - Code snippet: `Row(mainAxisAlignment:

MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween, children: penColors.map...)`

- SimpleActionControls updated to horizontal (88px width, 40px

height) - Undo/redo buttons in Row layout instead of Column

- `lib/design_system/pages/demo_shell.dart`
- Complete demo navigation shell with left sidebar
- Provides component categorization and navigation
- Important for team collaboration workflow

- `lib/design_system/pages/figma_pages/note_editor_demo.dart`
- Full page recreation of Figma design with interactive components
- Demonstrates complete toolbar functionality with state management

- `lib/design_system/routing/design_system_routes.dart`
- GoRouter configuration for demo system
- ShellRoute with nested demo pages

- `lib/features/home/pages/home_screen.dart`
- Added navigation button to design system demo
- Code snippet: NavigationCard with '/design-system/note-editor'

route

4.  Errors and fixes: - **Import path errors**: After moving components to ai_generated
    folder, had import path issues - Fixed by updating relative imports in raw_components to use './'
    prefix - User feedback: emphasized using ai_generated folder structure
    properly

- **Flutter analysis errors**: 526 issues found during analysis
- Fixed import paths for all moved components
- Updated component references to match new file locations

- **Architecture clarification**: Initially misunderstood the

separation strategy - User clarified: features = logic only, design_system = all UI - Adjusted approach to focus on design_system folder as complete UI
layer

5.  Problem Solving: - Researched industry standards for component showcasing (Widgetbook,
    Storybook patterns) - Implemented hybrid approach: GoRouter-based demo system with future
    Widgetbook migration path - Created comprehensive demo environment with component isolation and
    interaction testing - Solved horizontal layout conversion by extracting exact dimensions
    from updated Figma design - Established clear AI workflow: raw generation → ai_generated folder →
    future refinement in components folder

6.  All user messages: - "https://www.figma.com/design/MtvaMAiatLnIYEilnFKB2F/design-duplicate
    d?node-id=21-1697&m=dev designsystem 폴더에 알아서 잘 변환해줘." - "아니 features 에서 안쓸거야. features 에는 로직만 남겨두고
    design_system 폴더에서 모든 디자인을 넣을거야. 추후 features에 있는 위젯
    다 제거할거고. 이러면 어떻게 달라지는거야? 생각해봐" - "맞아. 근데 점진적으로 분리할거야. 방금 막 디자인 시스템 디렉토리를
    만들었고 첫 ai 변환을 수행했어. 때문에 너는 ai_generated 에 넣었어야해.
    지금은 features 안건드릴거야. 어떻게 해야할까?" - "ㅇㅋ 그러면 이거 어떻게 쓰라는거야. 지금 당장 라우터 설정만 하면
    바로 화면이 보이는 정도야? 지금은 그냥 컴포넌트 만들어준거 아닌가? page
    없이?" - "라우트만 만들면 어떡하냐. @lib\features\home\pages\home_screen.dart
    여기에 이동할 수 있게 해야지." - "1. https://www.figma.com/design/MtvaMAiatLnIYEilnFKB2F/design-duplic
    ated?node-id=21-1697&m=dev 이렇게 컴포넌트 90도 회전만 수정했어. 90도
    회전만 수정해주라. 상위 툴바 요소들 회전 수정했어. 2. 메인 노트는 2000px x
    2000px 짜리를 확대 / 축소 / 여러페이지 가능하도록 해둔상태야. 이거
    감안해서 지금 1000 x 1000 으로 표현된 컴포넌트가 노트 필기 화면이니까 . .
    감안해서 어떻게 수정할지 고민해봐." - "아니다 그냥 툴바만 수정해줘. phase2는 폐지." - "굿 잘 동작함."

7.  Pending Tasks:

- No explicit pending tasks identified from the conversation

8.  Current Work:
    The most recent work focused on updating the Figma toolbar design from
    vertical (90-degree rotated) layout to horizontal layout. This involved: - Extracting updated Figma design with horizontal toolbar sections - Converting all toolbar components from Column-based vertical layout
    to Row-based horizontal layout - Applying exact Figma dimensions: Navigation (402px), Color palette
    (154px), Pen type (155px), Pen thickness (204px), Undo/redo (88px),
    Settings (256px) - Testing the updated horizontal toolbar functionality - User confirmed: "굿 잘 동작함" (Good, works well)

The work was completed successfully with all components updated to

match the new Figma design specifications.

9.  Optional Next Step:
    No next step is indicated as the user confirmed the toolbar updates
    work well ("굿 잘 동작함"). The most recent request was specifically
    focused on toolbar horizontal layout conversion, which has been completed
    and validated. Any future work would require new explicit user direction..
