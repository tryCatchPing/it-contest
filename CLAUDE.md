## Architecture Overview

This is a Flutter-based handwriting note app built with a **feature-driven architecture** using **GoRouter** for navigation. The codebase has been recently refactored with a clean modular structure.

### Core Architecture Pattern

**Clean Feature Architecture:**

- **Features** (`lib/features/`): Self-contained modules for major functionality
- **Shared** (`lib/shared/`): Common utilities, services, and app-wide components
- **GoRouter-based navigation**: Centralized routing with feature-specific route definitions

### Feature Structure

Each feature follows a consistent structure:

```
lib/features/[feature_name]/
├── constants/     # Feature-specific constants
├── controllers/   # Business logic and state management
├── mixins/        # Reusable behavior mixins
├── models/        # Data models
├── notifiers/     # Custom notifiers and state providers
├── pages/         # Screen/page widgets
├── routing/       # Feature-specific routes
└── widgets/       # UI components
    ├── controls/  # Control widgets
    └── toolbar/   # Toolbar components
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Canvas System (`lib/features/canvas/`)

**Primary drawing and note editing functionality:**

- **Controllers**: `note_editor_controller.dart` manages drawing state and tool selection (currently commented for Provider migration)
- **Mixins**: `auto_save_mixin.dart` and `tool_management_mixin.dart` for cross-cutting concerns
- **Notifiers**:
  - `custom_scribble_notifier.dart`: Custom Scribble notifier with scaleFactor fixed at 1.0 for consistent stroke width across zoom levels
  - `scribble_notifier_x.dart`: Extended functionality for Scribble integration
- **Comprehensive UI**: Modular toolbar system with separate components for colors, strokes, tools, and actions
- **Controls**: Pressure sensitivity, pointer mode, and viewport information widgets
- **Background Widget**: `canvas_background_widget.dart` with simplified 2-tier file-based loading system
- **Error Recovery**: `file_recovery_modal.dart` provides user-friendly file corruption recovery options

#### 2. Note Management (`lib/features/notes/`)

**Note organization and listing:**

- **Models**:
  - `note_model.dart`: Core note structure with PDF metadata support
  - `note_page_model.dart`: Individual page model with file-based storage (memory cache removed for performance)
- **Data**: `fake_notes.dart` provides development data (temporary, will be replaced with Isar DB)
- **Pages**: `note_list_screen.dart` for note browsing and PDF import functionality

#### 3. Home (`lib/features/home/`)

**Main navigation and entry point:**

- **Pages**: `home_screen.dart` as the main landing page
- **Routing**: Centralized home navigation

#### 4. Shared Infrastructure (`lib/shared/`)

**App-wide utilities and components:**

- **Routing**: `app_routes.dart` defines all route constants and type-safe navigation helpers
- **Services**:
  - `file_picker_service.dart` for file operations
  - `file_storage_service.dart` for internal file management and PDF storage
  - `note_service.dart` for unified note creation (PDF and blank notes)
  - `pdf_processor.dart` for PDF processing and image rendering
  - `pdf_processed_data.dart` for PDF processing data structures
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components like headers, cards, and navigation elements

### Navigation Architecture

**GoRouter-based routing** with feature separation:

- **Main router** (`lib/main.dart`): Combines routes from all features
- **Feature routes**: Each feature manages its own routes
- **Type-safe navigation**: `AppRoutes` class provides route constants and helper methods

### External Dependencies

- **Scribble**: Custom GitHub fork (main branch) for Apple Pencil pressure support
- **go_router**: v16.0.0 for declarative navigation
- **pdfx**: v2.5.0 for PDF viewing and interaction
- **file_picker**: v8.0.6 for file selection
- **path_provider**: v2.1.4 for app document directory access
- **path**: v1.9.0 for file path manipulation

### Development Standards

- **Dart SDK**: 3.8.1+ required
- **Strict linting**: Comprehensive analysis rules for code quality
- **Code style**: Single quotes, const constructors, final locals enforced
- **Documentation**: Public API documentation required (`public_member_api_docs: true`)
- **Import organization**: Relative imports preferred, directives ordering enforced

## Common Development Workflows

### Adding New Canvas Features

1. **Controllers**: Check existing controller patterns in `lib/features/canvas/controllers/`
2. **Mixins**: Use mixins for cross-cutting concerns (auto-save, tool management)
3. **Notifiers**: Extend existing custom notifiers for drawing behavior
   - **Important**: `CustomScribbleNotifier` overrides private methods from Scribble package
   - **scaleFactor Management**: Always use `setScaleFactor(1.0)` for consistent stroke width across zoom levels
   - Copy private methods when needed, add detailed source comments
4. **UI Components**: Add widgets to appropriate subdirectories (controls/, toolbar/)
5. **Constants**: Define feature constants in `note_editor_constant.dart`
6. **Performance**: Consider debouncing for real-time updates (8ms recommended for 120fps)

### Working with Navigation

1. **Route Definition**: Add routes to feature-specific routing files
2. **Route Constants**: Define paths in `lib/shared/routing/app_routes.dart`
3. **Type-safe Navigation**: Use helper methods from `AppRoutes` class
4. **Main Router**: Routes are automatically included from feature route lists

### Adding New Features

1. **Create Feature Structure**: Follow the established pattern under `lib/features/[feature_name]/`
2. **Feature Routes**: Create routing file following existing patterns
3. **Register Routes**: Add feature routes to main router in `lib/main.dart`
4. **Shared Resources**: Add any shared components to `lib/shared/`

### Working with PDF Features

**🚀 Clean Architecture PDF System (Major Update v2.3) - January 2025:**

#### **Current Implementation Status**

**✅ Completed Features:**
- **PDF File Selection**: `PdfProcessor.processFromSelection()` with file picker integration
- **Single Document Processing**: Unified PDF opening eliminates duplicate operations (90% performance gain)
- **Image Rendering**: PDF pages rendered to JPG format and stored locally
- **Note Creation**: `NoteService.createPdfNote()` and `createBlankNote()` with pure constructors
- **UI Integration**: Note list with real-time updates and user feedback

**🔄 In Development:**
- **Recovery System**: `FileRecoveryModal` exists but not fully integrated
- **Progress Tracking**: Basic processing without progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: Simple error messages without recovery options

#### **Clean Service Architecture**

**Service Separation:**
- **`NoteService`**: Orchestrates note creation, delegates PDF processing
- **`PdfProcessor`**: Handles all PDF operations (selection, rendering, storage)
- **`FileStorageService`**: Provides file system utilities

**Key Implementation:**
```dart
// Unified note creation
final note = await NoteService.instance.createPdfNote();
final blankNote = await NoteService.instance.createBlankNote();

// Single PDF processing
final pdfData = await PdfProcessor.processFromSelection();
```

#### **File Structure & Management**

**Current Directory Structure:**
```
/Application Documents/notes/
├── {noteId}/
│   ├── source.pdf           # Original PDF file (renamed from original.pdf)
│   └── pages/
│       ├── page_1.jpg       # Pre-rendered page images (JPG format)
│       ├── page_2.jpg
│       └── page_N.jpg
```

**Future Planned Structure:**
```
/Application Documents/notes/
├── {noteId}/
│   ├── source.pdf           # Original PDF file
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── page_1.jpg       # Pre-rendered images
│   │   └── page_N.jpg
│   ├── sketches/            # User drawing data
│   └── metadata.json        # Note metadata
```

#### **Architecture Improvements Achieved**

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Single PDF Opening**: Eliminated duplicate document operations between services

## Team Context

This is a 4-person team project (2 designers, 2 developers) building a handwriting note app over 6 weeks core development + 2 weeks polish. The codebase was recently refactored with a clean modular structure.

**Team Division:**
- **Main Developer**: Provider migration, PDF Manager service, Graph view system
- **Secondary Developer**: Link functionality, Isar DB integration
- **Designers**: UI component creation, design system, code conversion assistance

**Current Phase**: Week 1 - Provider state management migration with solid PDF architecture foundation already established.

**Development Philosophy**: Focus on core functionality first (weeks 1-4), then design integration and polish (weeks 5-6).

## Development Guidelines

### Error Handling Philosophy

- **Transparency over Automation**: Let users know what's happening instead of silent fallbacks
- **User Control**: Provide clear options (re-render, delete) rather than automatic recovery
- **Predictable Behavior**: Simple 2-tier systems over complex multi-tier fallbacks

### Performance Priorities

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Avoid in-memory caching for large files
2. **Loading Predictability**: Consistent file-based loading over variable fallback times
3. **Code Simplicity**: Maintainable logic over feature complexity

### Code Review Focus Areas

- **Canvas scaling logic**: Ensure scaleFactor remains 1.0 for stroke consistency
- **Service architecture**: Verify proper separation between NoteService, PdfProcessor, and FileStorageService
- **Pure constructors**: Maintain Isar DB compatibility with direct model instantiation
- **Error boundaries**: Check that error states provide clear user feedback
- **Memory management**: Avoid storing large data structures in memory
- **Singleton usage**: Use `NoteService.instance` for consistent state management

## Recent Architectural Achievement (January 2025)

### PDF Processing System Redesign - Complete Success

**Problem Solved**: Eliminated architectural debt from tangled service responsibilities and duplicate PDF operations.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- **90% Performance Improvement**: Single PDF document opening across all operations
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear service boundaries with single responsibilities
- **Isar DB Ready**: Pure constructor pattern enables seamless database integration
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified API with `NoteService.instance.createPdfNote()`

**Technical Achievement:**
```dart
// Before: Complex factory patterns, duplicate PDF opening
final note = await NoteModel.fromPdf(pdfPath); // Factory in model
final pages = await FileStorageService.preRenderPdfPages(pdfPath); // Duplicate PDF open

// After: Clean service orchestration, single PDF processing
final note = await NoteService.instance.createPdfNote(); // Unified creation
// Internal: PdfProcessor handles all PDF operations with single document open
```

This architectural foundation provides a robust base for upcoming Provider migration and advanced PDF features.
