```

## Architecture Overview

This is a Flutter-based handwriting note app built with a **feature-driven architecture** using **GoRouter** for navigation.

### Core Architecture Pattern

**Clean Feature Architecture:**

- **Features** (`lib/features/`): Self-contained modules for major functionality
- **Shared** (`lib/shared/`): Common utilities, services, and app-wide components
- **GoRouter-based navigation**: Centralized routing with feature-specific route definitions

### Feature Structure

```
lib/features/[feature_name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/     # Feature-specific constants
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/   # Business logic and state management
â”œâ”€â”€ mixins/        # Reusable behavior mixins
â”œâ”€â”€ models/        # Data models
â”œâ”€â”€ notifiers/     # Custom notifiers and state providers
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # Screen/page widgets
â”œâ”€â”€ routing/       # Feature-specific routes
â””â”€â”€ widgets/       # UI components
    â”œâ”€â”€ controls/  # Control widgets
    â””â”€â”€ toolbar/   # Toolbar components
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Canvas System (`lib/features/canvas/`)

- Drawing state management with Provider migration in progress
- Custom Scribble notifier with scaleFactor fixed at 1.0 for consistent stroke width
- Modular toolbar system with controls for colors, strokes, tools
- PDF Recovery System with corruption detection

#### 2. Note Management (`lib/features/notes/`)

- Core note structure with PDF metadata support
- File-based storage (memory cache removed for performance)
- Note browsing and PDF import functionality
- Temporary fake data (will be replaced with Isar DB)

#### 3. Shared Infrastructure (`lib/shared/`)

- **Services**: File operations, PDF processing, note creation, storage management
- **Routing**: GoRouter-based navigation with type-safe helpers
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components

### External Dependencies

- **Scribble**: Custom GitHub fork for Apple Pencil pressure support
- **go_router**: v16.0.0 for navigation
- **pdfx**: v2.5.0 for PDF viewing
- **file_picker**: v8.0.6 for file selection

### Development Standards

- **Dart SDK**: 3.8.1+ required
- **Strict linting** with comprehensive analysis rules
- **Code style**: Single quotes, const constructors, final locals enforced
- **Documentation**: Public API documentation required

## Development Guidelines

### Canvas Development

- **scaleFactor Management**: Always use `setScaleFactor(1.0)` for consistent stroke width
- **Performance**: Use 8ms debouncing for real-time updates (120fps)
- **Custom Notifiers**: Override private Scribble methods with detailed source comments

### Adding New Features

1. Follow feature structure pattern under `lib/features/[feature_name]/`
2. Create feature-specific routing files
3. Register routes in main router
4. Add shared components to `lib/shared/`

### PDF System Architecture

**Current Implementation:**

- **NoteService**: Orchestrates note creation, delegates PDF processing
- **PdfProcessor**: Handles all PDF operations (selection, rendering, storage)
- **PdfRecoveryService**: Corruption detection and recovery options

**Key Usage:**

```dart
// Unified note creation
final note = await NoteService.instance.createPdfNote();
final blankNote = await NoteService.instance.createBlankNote();
```

**File Structure:**

```
/Application Documents/notes/
â”œâ”€â”€ {noteId}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ source.pdf           # Original PDF file
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ page_1.jpg       # Pre-rendered page images
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ page_N.jpg
```

**Performance Features:**

- Single PDF opening (90% performance improvement)
- File-based storage (memory efficiency)
- Pure constructors (Isar DB ready)

## Current Status

**State Management Transition:**

- Transitioning to Provider for state management
- Current controllers commented for Provider migration
- Custom notifiers extend Scribble functionality

**Testing:**

- Use `fvm flutter test` to run all tests
- Focus on canvas functionality and PDF integration

## Work Distribution Strategy

## Team Context

4-person team (2 designers, 2 developers) building a handwriting note app over 6 weeks core development + 2 weeks polish.

**Team Division:**

- **Main Developer**: Provider migration, PDF Manager service, Graph view system
- **Secondary Developer**: Link functionality, Isar DB integration
- **Designers**: UI component creation, design system, code conversion assistance

**Current Phase**: Week 1 - Provider state management migration with solid PDF architecture foundation established.

## Development Philosophy

### Error Handling

- **Transparency over Automation**: Clear user feedback instead of silent fallbacks
- **User Control**: Provide options (re-render, delete) rather than automatic recovery
- **Predictable Behavior**: Simple systems over complex fallbacks

### Performance Priorities

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Avoid in-memory caching for large files
2. **Loading Predictability**: Consistent file-based loading
3. **Code Simplicity**: Maintainable logic over feature complexity

### Code Review Focus

- **Canvas scaling**: Ensure scaleFactor remains 1.0 for stroke consistency
- **Service architecture**: Proper separation between services
- **Pure constructors**: Isar DB compatibility
- **Memory management**: Avoid storing large data structures in memory
- **Singleton usage**: Use `NoteService.instance` for consistent state management
